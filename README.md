# earnings-helper

CLI Program that helps you track upcoming company earnings using web scraping through multiple websites (with earnings calendars) and choosing the most repeatedly listed stock on each site to have the most accurate information.

## Usage

First build the source code by adding the `--release` flag and then find the *runnable* file in the `target` folder.

Before running the program download [chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and start it in another terminal. Most of the time you will need the most recent available version.

Run:

```console
$ earnings-helper --help
```

for usage info.

> Running the parser in `preview` mode will sometimes fail!
